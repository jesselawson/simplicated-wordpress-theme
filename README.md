Simplicated WordPress Theme
===========================

(1-Dec-2013 lawsonry) A long time ago I created this theme as a way to play around with some ideas I had with an options framework template. Unfortunately, the theme never really did finish, and I put it here in GitHub at the request of a few friends. 

Recently someone has reached out and encouraged me to complete the theme, and I'll take them up on this offer. What I'd like to do is keep Simplicated here on GitHub but finish developing it. 

Simplicated is still a minimalist blogging template with a focus on textual presentation.
